The guest house is a quaint 400square ft. with a full bath, mini kitchen & living room. The extra high ceilings make the home feel more spacioous. The sofa converts to a bed also. We have a hand made counter area that adds character to the room and a great porch/deck to relax on and have a glass of Merlot.</div>

                                	<p class="review_text">Fantastic place. It was clean, Mshila was great (even though we did not meet in person) and everything went super smooth. Location is also great if you like running and something a bit more quiet. I would suggest a car or take into consideration that you might have to Uber into the city from the location. Overall, would recommend the place anytime.</p>

However thanks to the kindness of my host Andrew and the excellent customer service of my contact at AirBnb, Jay, I received a full refund. I have already stayed many times with Air Bnb but in future I will choose them over their competitors because of the wonderful way they dealt with this situation.</p>
